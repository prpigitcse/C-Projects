# CSV Reader Program

## Overview

This is a simple CSV reader program written in C that reads a CSV file (`input.csv`), parses the data, and displays it in a formatted tabular form on the terminal. The program also handles and displays the CSV header, ensuring that the output is well-organized and easy to read.

## Features

- **CSV Parsing**: The program reads and parses data from a CSV file with the format `First Name, Last Name, Age`.
- **Header Support**: The first line of the CSV file is treated as the header and is displayed in the table format.
- **Formatted Output**: Data is displayed in a clean, tabular format with aligned columns for easy readability.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if there is an issue while opening the file or parsing a line.
- **Cross-platform ANSI Coloring**: The terminal output is enhanced with colored and formatted text for an improved user experience.
